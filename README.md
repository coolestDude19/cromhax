# CromHax

A package of tools that will allow you to unenroll a **legally owned** Chromebook that may have been bought off the used market without knowing it was enrolled, a Chromebook that has been given to you but released after you were done, or perhaps a motherboard replacement for a Chromebook you have gotten, but it was enrolled.

> **Note:** This package does not have any affiliation with the provided tools. They are to only be used for the intended purpose, and if not used as intended, I will not be held responsible for any damages done.
